        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>Why did you do this?</h3>

        Well, we all have our passions. Mine takes me to the numbers.

        <br><br>

        When I watch games, I think of questions. When I think of questions, I try to find the answers. When I find the answers, I share them.

        <br><br>

        Plus, this was good practice for me. I'm not a web designer, but I wanted to learn some new things.

        <h3>How did you do this?</h3>

        Mostly with Python. Some Jinja. Some Github.

        <br><br>

        For the source data, I'm fetching Paul's <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pkFTsauIO3UZcW0J2qRzzIg60WigGIrtn2SraO7tVNs/edit#gid=0"> Google Spreadsheet</a>

        <h3>Are you as cool as this looks?</h3>

        You can't prove I'm not.

        <h3>How can I help?</h3>

        I need someone to volunteer to "clean up" some of the source data. Specifically, column E, the cause of death column.
        If that data were more standardized, I could run an analysis of the death types encountered by Paul.

        <br><br>

        What's the problem?

        <br><br>

        For example, some things are listed as 'Stage8' and sometimes 's8'. I could write regexes, and I will if no
        one helps clean it up, but that will come later.

        <h3>Why didn't you use any of those sexy new javascript graphing libraries?</h3>

        You had to bring that up, didn't you?

        <br><br>

        Well, I'm getting there. I'll dive into that as time permits and make updates.

        <h3>I would like to send you money to support your data habit, how can I do that?</h3>

        I would also like you to send me money. I'll try to get something set up for that.
